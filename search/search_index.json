It prevents shocks when using household appliances, for example.</p> <p>In the case of your Carbon, grounding is not just a safety issue but also influences the machine's operation. The CO2 laser requires high voltage (20,000 volts), generating an electromagnetic field that induces a current.

The parameter that worked well for cutting a specific type of acrylic may not be ideal for another type, even if both are classified as acrylics.
