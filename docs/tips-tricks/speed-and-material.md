# The influence of speed and power for the same material

Determining the ideal cutting parameters can be a challenging process in some cases. Although we can offer an approximate estimate of the power/speed range for a given material, several factors influence this definition, which can make it imprecise.

In this article, we will address some of these factors to provide a more comprehensive understanding, but be sure to check out our practical guide on how to perform tests to obtain more precise parameters for your specific work.

## Material composition:

* Materials can vary in their composition, even if they are categorized under the same name. For example, different types of MDF can be made from various woods, resulting in different behaviors during cutting.
* Additionally, the manufacturing process can generate variations in the final products, even if they are made from the same components.

Therefore, it is crucial to understand that similar materials can exhibit different behaviors during the cutting process. The parameter that worked well for cutting a specific type of acrylic may not be ideal for another type, even if both are classified as acrylics. For this reason, performing tests on the specific material to be used is essential to determine the ideal parameters. To help with this process, we offer an article where you can access and download some files to test different parameter configurations.

## Focus adjustment:

An improper focus adjustment can also affect the determination of cutting parameters. Make sure the focus is correctly adjusted to ensure accurate and consistent results. Check out our article on how to ensure [proper focus adjustment] for more information.

## Cleaning the mirrors and lens:

Regular cleaning of the mirrors and lens is crucial, as dirt can interfere with the quality of the laser beam. If the set of mirrors and lens are dirty, less light will be reflected onto the material, which may require parameter adjustments to compensate. Keeping the machine maintenance up to date is essential to ensure consistent and high-quality results.
