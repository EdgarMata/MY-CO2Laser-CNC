# Gadget Carbon Safety Instructions:

At Gadget, our priority is to ensure your safety and the safety of the machine. Therefore, it is crucial that you read this article carefully and follow our guidelines.

## Maintain constant supervision!

It is essential that you never leave your Gadget Carbon operating without your attention. When starting any task, closely monitor the cutting and marking operations throughout the process.

If you notice any irregularities, immediately turn off the machine.

## Always operate with the lid closed

For your safety, the Gadget Carbon automatically stops working when the lid is opened and resumes from where it left off when the lid is closed. However, if you lift the lid and the work continues, avoid placing your hands inside the machine.
The laser beam is invisible and reflects off the side mirrors of the machine, potentially causing skin burns.
