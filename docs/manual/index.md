</figure>

* NEVER leave the machine operating unattended without the supervision of a qualified professional, especially during long cutting or engraving jobs.
* Do not connect the machine's power cable to an extension cord with multiple devices simultaneously.
* Ensure that the materials to be cut are safe for use with the laser cutting machine and are within the machine's specifications. NEVER use prohibited materials such as CHLORINE or VINYL compounds.
* Ensure that the operating area is well-ventilated to eliminate possible toxic fumes or gases produced during the laser cutting process.
* Follow the manufacturer's recommended maintenance schedule to ensure proper machine operation.
* Keep a fire extinguisher near the machine and know how to use it in case of fire. Keep flammable materials away from the work area.
* In case of malfunction, immediately turn off the machine and contact support.

Safety during the operation of the Carbon Laser Cutting and Engraving Machine is an absolute priority.
To ensure safe and risk-free operation, Carbon is equipped with intelligent sensors that constantly monitor operating conditions:

1. Open Lid Sensor, which does not allow the process to proceed when the lid is not properly closed.
2. Temperature Sensor, which pauses operation in conditions of excessive heat.
3. Level Sensor that controls the water level in the chiller reservoir, ensuring it is always adequate for optimal performance.

## Machine Care

Regularly clean the lenses and optical mirrors to maintain cutting quality.

Use damp cotton swabs to clean, always very gently, in circular motions, and change the cotton swab until it comes out completely clean.

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

Use distilled or demineralized water in the cooling system to prevent the formation of mineral deposits that could obstruct the flow.

1. When removing the product from the packaging, place it on a flat and ventilated surface, near an air outlet.
2. Using a key, remove the internal lock and transport protections.
3. Insert the honeycomb inside the machine.
4. In the internal reservoir, using a funnel, add approximately 3.2L of distilled or demineralized water. Once the level is reached, save the remaining water to top up later.
5. At the rear, connect the exhaust hose and the power cable, then turn on the machine.

Now, to proceed with the next steps of configuring the machine, we will need to connect the machine to a computer through the Carbon software.

## Software Installation

1. Download Carbon Studio from our website: www.gadgetplus.pt
2. With the program open, connect via Wifi or USB cable. See below how each type of connection works:

![](../images/ImgManual_13.png){ align=left }

After the water circulates internally through the machine hoses, check the internal reservoir again and add the remaining demineralized water.

Total amount 3.2L.

Done! Now your laser machine is ready to start cutting and engraving.

!!! warning "Attention"
    
    Ensure that there are no air bubbles in the hose through which the demineralized water passes.
    These air bubbles are extremely dangerous to the CO2 laser.

    If there are, check our knowledge base for the procedure to [remove the bubbles].
