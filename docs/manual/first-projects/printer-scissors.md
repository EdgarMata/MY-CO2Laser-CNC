In this article, we will discuss the cutting, contouring, and filling functions available in the layer manager of your Carbon Studio. It is crucial to understand these distinctions to perform your work in the best possible way.

The first step is to visualize the layer manager, located on the right side of Carbon Studio, as shown in Figure 1 below:

Now, let's take a closer look at the layer manager to explore its items:

## Let's start with the printer item:

Whenever you want to work with filling, you need to select the printer item. Filling works like a printer, executing several horizontal lines to mark the material with the desired design. To change the icons, just click on them.

## Next, we have the brush/pen item:

If your goal is to work with contouring, you should select the brush item. Contouring represents the outline of your vector, following the same path as the laser cut. However, the contouring power is lower, just enough to draw on the material.

## Finally, we have the scissors item:

Whenever you want to work with cuts, select the scissors item. The cut will perform the material cut based on the lines of your design.
